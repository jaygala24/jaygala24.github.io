  author   = {Jay Gala and Pengtao Xie},
  abstract = {In many image classification applications, the number of labeled training images is limited, which leads to model overfitting. To mitigate the lack of training data, deep generative models have been leveraged to generate synthetic training data. However, existing methods generate data for individual classes based on how much training data they have without considering their actual data needs. To address this limitation, we propose needs-aware image generation, which automatically identifies the different data needs of individual classes based on their classification performance and divides a limited data generation budget into these classes according to their needs. We propose a multi-level optimization based framework which performs four learning stages in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on both imbalanced and balanced classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  author   = {Everlyn Chimoto and Jay Gala and Orevaoghene Ahia and Julia Kreutzer and Bruce Bassett and Sara Hooker},
  abstract = {Neural Machine Translation models are extremely data and compute-hungry. However, not all data points contribute equally to model training and generalization. Data pruning to remove the low-value data points has the benefit of drastically reducing the compute budget without significant drop in model performance. In this paper, we propose a new data pruning technique: Checkpoints Across Time (CAT), that leverages early model training dynamics to identify the most relevant data points for model performance. We benchmark CAT against several data pruning techniques including COMET-QE, LASER and LaBSE. We find that CAT outperforms the benchmarks on Indo-European languages on multiple test sets. When applied to English-German, English-French and English-Swahili translation tasks, CAT achieves comparable performance to using the full dataset, while pruning up to 50% of training data. We inspect the data points that CAT selects and find that it tends to favour longer sentences and sentences with unique or rare words.},

  author   = {Pranjal A. Chitale* and Jay Gala* and Raj Dabre},
  abstract = {Recent interest has surged in employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for machine translation (MT) via in-context learning (ICL) (Vilar et al., 2023). Most prior studies primarily focus on optimizing translation quality, with limited attention to understanding the specific aspects of ICL that influence the said quality. To this end, we perform the first of its kind, an exhaustive study of in-context learning for machine translation. We first establish that ICL is primarily example-driven and not instruction-driven. Following this, we conduct an extensive exploration of various aspects of the examples to understand their influence on downstream performance. Our analysis includes factors such as quality and quantity of demonstrations, spatial proximity, and source versus target originality. Further, we also investigate challenging scenarios involving indirectness and misalignment of examples to understand the limits of ICL. While we establish the significance of the quality of the target distribution over the source distribution of demonstrations, we further observe that perturbations sometimes act as regularizers, resulting in performance improvements. Surprisingly, ICL does not necessitate examples from the same task, and a related task with the same target distribution proves sufficient. We hope that our study acts as a guiding resource for considerations in utilizing ICL for MT.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the challenge of extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to non-English languages, specifically those using non-Roman scripts. We propose an approach that utilizes the romanized form of text as an interface for LLMs, hypothesizing that its frequent informal use and shared tokens with English enhance cross-lingual alignment. Our approach involves the continual pretraining of an English LLM like Llama 2 on romanized text of non-English, non-Roman script languages, followed by instruction tuning on romanized data. The results indicate that romanized text not only reduces token fertility by 2x-4x but also matches if not outperforms native script representation across various NLU, NLG, and MT tasks. Moreover, the embeddings computed on romanized text exhibit closer alignment with their English translations than those from the native script. Our approach presents a promising direction for leveraging the power of English LLMs in languages traditionally underrepresented in NLP research.},

  abstract = {The strength of modern large-scale neural networks lies in their ability to efficiently adapt to new tasks with few examples. Although extensive research has investigated the transferability of Vision Transformers (ViTs) to various downstream tasks under diverse constraints, this study shifts focus to explore the transfer learning potential of [V]-Mamba. We compare its performance with ViTs across different few-shot data budgets and efficient transfer methods. Our analysis yields three key insights into [V]-Mamba's few-shot transfer performance: (a) [V]-Mamba demonstrates superior or equivalent few-shot learning capabilities compared to ViTs when utilizing linear probing (LP) for transfer, (b) Conversely, [V]-Mamba exhibits weaker or similar few-shot learning performance compared to ViTs when employing visual prompting (VP) as the transfer method, and (c) We observe a weak positive correlation between the performance gap in transfer via LP and VP and the scale of the [V]-Mamba model. This preliminary analysis lays the foundation for more comprehensive studies aimed at furthering our understanding of the capabilities of [V]-Mamba variants and their distinctions from ViTs.},

We observe that backtranslation leads to substantial improvements in translation quality up to 4 BLEU points. We also develop 2 contrastive systems on unconstrained settings, where the first system involves fine-tuning of IndicTrans2 DA models on official parallel corpora and seed data used in AI4Bharat et al, (2023), and the second system involves a system combination of the primary and the aforementioned system.

  abstract = {India has a rich linguistic landscape with languages from 4 major language families spoken by over a billion people. 22 of these languages are listed in the Constitution of India (referred to as scheduled languages) are the focus of this work. Given the linguistic diversity, high-quality and accessible Machine Translation (MT) systems are essential in a country like India. Prior to this work, there was (i) no parallel training data spanning all the 22 languages, (ii) no robust benchmarks covering all these languages and containing content relevant to India, and (iii) no existing translation models which support all the 22 scheduled languages of India. In this work, we aim to address this gap by focusing on the missing pieces required for enabling wide, easy, and open access to good machine translation systems for all 22 scheduled Indian languages. We identify four key areas of improvement: curating and creating larger training datasets, creating diverse and high-quality benchmarks, training multilingual models, and releasing models with open access. Our first contribution is the release of the Bharat Parallel Corpus Collection (BPCC), the largest publicly available parallel corpora for Indic languages. BPCC contains a total of 230M bitext pairs, of which a total of 126M were newly added, including 644K manually translated sentence pairs created as part of this work. Our second contribution is the release of the first n-way parallel benchmark covering all 22 Indian languages, featuring diverse domains, Indian-origin content, and source-original test sets. Next, we present IndicTrans2, the first model to support all 22 languages, surpassing existing models on multiple existing and new benchmarks created as a part of this work. Lastly, to promote accessibility and collaboration, we release our models and associated data with permissive licenses at https://github.com/ai4bharat/indictrans2.},

In this work, we aim to investigate how effectively we can leverage this exceptional learning ability to improve machine learning models. We propose a simple and effective multi-level optimization framework called learning from mistakes using class weighting (LFM-CW), inspired by mistake-driven learning to train better machine learning models. In this formulation, the primary objective is to train a model to perform effectively on target tasks by using a re-weighting technique. We learn the class weights by minimizing the validation loss of the model and re-train the model with the synthetic data from the image generator weighted by class-wise performance and real data. We apply our LFM-CW framework with differential architecture search methods on image classification datasets such as CIFAR and ImageNet, where the results show that our proposed strategy achieves lower error rate than the baselines.},

Deep learning-based techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with self-attention mechanisms have been employed. Responses generated by such models, in some cases, are more biased towards dialog history and are not very relevant to the actual question asked.

This can be achieved to some extent with the help of an autonomous system that will aim at reducing human dependency. In this paper, one of such systems, a pothole detection and dimension estimation, is proposed. The proposed system uses a Deep Learning based algorithm YOLO (You Only Look Once) for pothole detection. Further, an image processing based triangular similarity measure is used for pothole dimension estimation. The proposed system provides reasonably accurate results of both pothole detection and dimension estimation. The proposed system also helps in reducing the time required for road maintenance. The system uses a custom made dataset consisting of images of water-logged and dry potholes of various shapes and sizes.},
