  abstract = {We announce the initial release of Airavata, an instruction-tuned LLM for Hindi. Airavata was created by fine-tuning OpenHathi with diverse, instruction-tuning Hindi datasets to make it better suited for assistive tasks. Along with the model, we also share the IndicInstruct dataset, which is a collection of diverse instruction-tuning datasets to enable further research for Indic LLMs. Additionally, we present evaluation benchmarks and a framework for assessing LLM performance across tasks in Hindi. Currently, Airavata supports Hindi, but we plan to expand this to all 22 scheduled Indic languages. You can access all artifacts at https://ai4bharat.github.io/airavata.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we (Team NICT-AI4B) describe our MT systems that we submit to the Indic MT task in WMT 2023. Our primary system consists of 3 stages: Joint denoising and MT training using officially approved monolingual and parallel corpora, backtranslation and, MT training on original and backtranslated parallel corpora. We observe that backtranslation leads to substantial improvements in translation quality up to 4 BLEU points. We also develop 2 contrastive systems on unconstrained settings, where the first system involves fine-tuning of IndicTrans2 DA models on official parallel corpora and seed data used in AI4Bharat et al, (2023), and the second system involves a system combination of the primary and the aforementioned system. Overall, we manage to obtain high-quality translation systems for the 4 low-resource North-East Indian languages of focus.},

  abstract = {India has a rich linguistic landscape with languages from 4 major language families spoken by over a billion people. 22 of these languages are listed in the Constitution of India (referred to as scheduled languages) are the focus of this work. Given the linguistic diversity, high-quality and accessible Machine Translation (MT) systems are essential in a country like India. Prior to this work, there was (i) no parallel training data spanning all the 22 languages, (ii) no robust benchmarks covering all these languages and containing content relevant to India, and (iii) no existing translation models which support all the 22 scheduled languages of India. In this work, we aim to address this gap by focusing on the missing pieces required for enabling wide, easy, and open access to good machine translation systems for all 22 scheduled Indian languages. We identify four key areas of improvement: curating and creating larger training datasets, creating diverse and high-quality benchmarks, training multilingual models, and releasing models with open access. Our first contribution is the release of the Bharat Parallel Corpus Collection (BPCC), the largest publicly available parallel corpora for Indic languages. BPCC contains a total of 230M bitext pairs, of which a total of 126M were newly added, including 644K manually translated sentence pairs created as part of this work. Our second contribution is the release of the first n-way parallel benchmark covering all 22 Indian languages, featuring diverse domains, Indian-origin content, and source-original test sets. Next, we present IndicTrans2, the first model to support all 22 languages, surpassing existing models on multiple existing and new benchmarks created as a part of this work. Lastly, to promote accessibility and collaboration, we release our models and associated data with permissive licenses at https://github.com/ai4bharat/indictrans2.},

In spite of the attention and the sensitive nature of the task, privacy preservation in hate speech detection has remained under-studied. The majority of research has focused on centralised machine learning infrastructures which risk leaking data. In this paper, we show that using federated machine learning can help address privacy the concerns that are inehrent to hate speech detection while obtaining up to 6.81% improvement in terms of F1-score.},

  author   = {Gala, Jay and Xie, Pengtao},
  abstract = {Learning from mistakes is an effective learning approach widely used in human learning, where a learner pays greater focus on mistakes to circumvent them in the future to improve the overall learning outcomes. In this work, we aim to investigate how effectively we can leverage this exceptional learning ability to improve machine learning models. We propose a simple and effective multi-level optimization framework called learning from mistakes using class weighting (LFM-CW), inspired by mistake-driven learning to train better machine learning models. In this formulation, the primary objective is to train a model to perform effectively on target tasks by using a re-weighting technique. We learn the class weights by minimizing the validation loss of the model and re-train the model with the synthetic data from the image generator weighted by class-wise performance and real data. We apply our LFM-CW framework with differential architecture search methods on image classification datasets such as CIFAR and ImageNet, where the results show that our proposed strategy achieves lower error rate than the baselines.},

  abstract  = {Machines cannot outperform human intelligence yet; however, an image-based dialog can enable machines to perceive cues from different modalities and process information in a more human-like manner. The proposed solution is an AI-based agent that can have engaging conversations with humans by considering an image and answering questions about its visual content, taking into account both visual and textual context. Deep learning-based techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with self-attention mechanisms have been employed. Responses generated by such models, in some cases, are more biased towards dialog history and are not very relevant to the actual question asked. The proposed work focuses on reducing the modality biases without compromising dialog history and improving the visual context through the use of dense captions to describe various entities in the image and generate relevant answers.},

  abstract  = {The world is advancing towards an autonomous environment at a great pace and it has become a need of an hour, especially during the current pandemic situation. The pandemic has hindered the functioning of many sectors, one of them being Road development and maintenance. Creating a safe working environment for workers is a major concern of road maintenance during such difficult times. This can be achieved to some extent with the help of an autonomous system that will aim at reducing human dependency. In this paper, one of such systems, a pothole detection and dimension estimation, is proposed. The proposed system uses a Deep Learning based algorithm YOLO (You Only Look Once) for pothole detection. Further, an image processing based triangular similarity measure is used for pothole dimension estimation. The proposed system provides reasonably accurate results of both pothole detection and dimension estimation. The proposed system also helps in reducing the time required for road maintenance. The system uses a custom made dataset consisting of images of water-logged and dry potholes of various shapes and sizes.},

  abstract  = {There is always a significant amount of challenges associated with waste and its disposal, which can be essentially mitigated by the use of technology. As the urban population increases, the amount of waste disposal is also increasing at an unprecedented rate. The inappropriate disposal of this waste will lead to many hazards including the risk of fires in the dump yards that leverages poisonous smoke in the atmosphere by adversely affecting the safety of nearby residential areas. Monitoring the occurrence of fire in huge dumping grounds manually is a tough task and thus developing an automatic fire extinguishing system is highly required. The advanced technologies can be leveraged to ensure the protection and safety of people by eliminating such hazardous risks. The air quality index (AQI) is an indicator of daily air quality report that shows how air quality affects a person's life in a very short time. AQI plays a key role in ensuring the safety of residential areas. The proposed system aims to aid the possible hazardous risks associated with the dump yard and waste management.},

Considering this, the proposed smart farming solution aims to aid the farmers by means of technology so as to increase their yield by suggesting to them the crops that will be most profitable for them as well as automating the irrigation system for them. This in turn will be a major help to the agriculture community as a whole and also set free the farmers from certain rudimentary tasks.},
