Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am an AI Resident at [AI4Bharat (IIT Madras)](https://ai4bharat.org/) under the supervision of [Prof. Mitesh Khapra](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/), [Dr. Anoop Kunchukuttan](http://anoopk.in/) and [Dr. Raj Dabre](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=x91u618AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I work on building open-source datasets and models for Indian languages. I am broadly interested in the areas of multimodal and multilingual learning, specifically in the context of data-efficient learning, training dynamics, reasoning and generalization.

I am also collaborating with [Dr. Zeerak Talat](https://zeerak.org/) on hate speech detection using federated learning. Before that, I was a research intern at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/), where I worked on neural architecture search and generative models.

I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from [University of Mumbai](https://www.djsce.ac.in/), India. In the past, I was a machine learning intern at [Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com/) where I worked on understanding customer behavior using natural language processing. Before that, I collaborated with Prof. Pratik Kanani on an industry project focusing on anomaly detection in heart rate (pulse) using IoT and machine learning.

I also served as a mentor at [DJ Unicode](https://www.djunicode.in/), a student organization that aims to inspire sophomores and juniors to contribute to open-source projects. Additionally, I led a team that developed a platform for conducting C programming examinations in college for over 500 students ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn7lwJoYfuU)).

I co-founded the research division of Unicode (a.k.a. [Unicode Research](https://unicode-research.netlify.app/people/)) with [Swapneel Mehta](https://mehtaver.se/) from [NYU CSMaP group](https://csmapnyu.org/). We were fortunate to be joined by [Dr. Akash Srivastava](https://akashgit.github.io/) from [MIT-IBM AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) for foundational lectures on deep generative models and probabilistic machine learning. I also worked as a teaching assistant for the [Unicode Machine Learning Summer Course 2021](https://djunicode.github.io/umlsc-2021/) supported by **Google Research India**. Additionally, I was a founding research engineer at [SimPPL](https://simppl.org/) where I collaborated with The Sunday Times and Ippen Digital to develop tools ([parrot.report](https://parrot.report/)) that help policymakers and journalists audit online disinformation on social media.
